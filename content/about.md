I am a .NET Developer based in Calgary, Canada. I have been a professional software developer since 2003. For the last 7 years, I have been working extensively with AWS and Kubernetes, building microservice-based applications with C#, NServiceBus, Terraform, and a host of other fun tech. I am passionate about learning and exploring new technologies, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. In my free time, I love to ski and play board games with my friends and family. Thank you for taking the time to read my bio!
